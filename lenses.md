## glass:
- very optically clear
- very scratch resistant
- very heavy (CON)
- can't be combined with many modern frames, photochromic, tints, coatings, that you can with plastic.
- can be made thinner than any other material, quite a bit thinner (PRO)
- 99% of spectacles are not glass. 


## CR-39 Plastic: Columbia Resin #39; the 39th formula of a thermosetting plastic developed by the Columbia Resins project in 1940.
- history: initial
- half the weight (re glass)
- can do coating, treatments, etc.
- bad for rimless or half rim frames
- not scratch resistant, needs coating
- MISC:
  - An alternative use includes a purified version that is used to measure neutron radiation, a type of ionizing radiation, in neutron dosimetry.
  - Although CR-39 is a type of polycarbonate, it should not be confused with the general term "polycarbonate", a tough homopolymer usually made from bisphenol A.
Optics:
- index of refraction of 1.498 and an Abbe number of 58.
- CR-39 is transparent in the visible spectrum and is almost completely opaque in the ultraviolet range.
- It has high abrasion resistance, in fact the highest abrasion/scratch resistance of any uncoated optical plastic.
- CR-39 is about half the weight of glass with an index of refraction only slightly lower than that of crown glass, and its high Abbe number yields low chromatic aberration.
- Poly(allyl diglycol carbonate) (PADC) is a plastic commonly used in the manufacture of eyeglass lenses alongside the material PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate). 
- The monomer is allyl diglycol carbonate (ADC). The term CR-39 technically refers to the ADC monomer, but is more commonly used to refer to the finished plastic.



## Polycarbonate
- bulletproof glass is made of this. 
- also born out of military applications
- works with rimless and half rim frames
- Cons:
  - not optically great to look through. has low Abbe value (=). Lowest Abbe value compared to any other material.
  - Abbe value: how evently differnt frequencies pass throught the lens (frequency dispersion).    
- pros:
- 


## Trivex:
- invented for military aircraft 
- high Abbe value, good as CR39, close to glass but not quite as good.
- optically clear.


99% of lenses nowadays are NOT made of glass. Before the 1960's most lenses were glass.

Refractive index: how much a meterial bends light.

- You can get glass lenses made thinner than the thinnest plastics.
