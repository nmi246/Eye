glass:
- very optically clear
- very scratch resistant
- very heavy (CON)
- can't be combined with many modern frames, photochromic, tints, coatings, that you can with plastic.
- can be made thinner than any other material, quite a bit thinner (PRO)
- 99% of spectacles are not glass. 


Plastic (CR39): coloumbia resin 39
- history: initial
- half the weight (re glass)
- can do coating, treatments, etc.
- bad for rimless or half rim frames
- not scratch resistant, needs coating


Polycarbonate
- bulletproof glass is made of this. 
- also born out of military applications
- works with rimless and half rim frames
- Cons:
  - not optically great to look through. has low Abbe value (=). Lowest Abbe value compared to any other material.
  - Abbe value: how evently differnt frequencies pass throught the lens (frequency dispersion).    
- pros:
- 


Trivex:
- invented for military aircraft 
- high Abbe value, good as CR39, close to glass but not quite as good.
- optically clear.


99% of lens are now made of glass.

Refractive index: how much a meterial bends light.

- You can get glass lenses made thinner than the thinnest plastics.
