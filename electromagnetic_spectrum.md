## Electromagnetic spectrum

Visible light:
- Typically, the human eye can detect wavelengths from 380 to 700 nanometers.


Ultraviolet:
- UVA: 400-315 nm
- UVB: 315-280 nm
- UVC: 280-100 nm

The Sun is a source of the full spectrum of ultraviolet radiation, which
is commonly subdivided into UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C. These are the classifications most often used in Earth sciences. UV-C rays are the most
harmful and are almost completely absorbed by our atmosphere. UV-B
rays are the harmful rays that cause sunburn. Exposure to UV-B rays
increases the risk of DNA and other cellular damage in living organisms.
Fortunately, about 95 percent of the UV-B rays are absorbed by ozone in
the Earthâ€™s atmosphere.
